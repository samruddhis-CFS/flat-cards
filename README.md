## ðŸ—» Project Overview

This project is a **mini Kashmir Tourism mobile website** built using **React Native**. It presents various aspects of Kashmir tourism including scenic destinations, adventure activities, and local highlights. The app uses different types of custom-designed card components to create a visually rich and scrollable UI.
